**Nuclear Logo Preview:**

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '50px' }}>
  <img
    src="../library/logos/logo-light-preview.png"
    alt="light logo of Nuclear"
    width={200}
    height={200}
    style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }}
  />
  <img
    src="../library/logos/logo-dark-preview.png"
    alt="dark logo of Nuclear"
    width={200}
    height={200}
    style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }}
  />
</div>

The idea for the logo is the lowercase letter of Greek Alphabet, 'Nu'.

The logo itself is imitating a stroke of an ink pen drawing the letter with a gradient on one of the ends. The secondary color in the gradient represents the current mode of the app.

The stroke of the logo originally started as a physical drawing in my notebook.
