<img src="../library/logos/logo-light-preview.png" alt="light logo of nuclear" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;" />

The idea for the logo is the lowercase letter of Greek Alphabet, 'Nu'.

The logo itself is imitating a stroke of an ink pen drawing the letter with a gradient on one of the ends. The secondary color in the gradient represents the current mode of the app.
